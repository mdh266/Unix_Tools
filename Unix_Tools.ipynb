    "Knowing Unix tools and Bash commands are not the sexiest part of data science and is often the most overlooked skillset.  During my time as a Ph.D. student in Computational Science/Applied Mathematics I picked up a bunch of unix commands that were life savers and I'm going to go over a few here. Learning these skills is definitely can seem a little bit boring, but I cannot emphasize how useful they are. Setting up my unix environment and linking various libraries was one of the most frustrating parts of graduate school, but I believe I am much more productive as a data scientist having learned these valuable lessons.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the commands and concepts I will be going over don't require any special libraries and when they do I'll provide links to them.  Infact most of the unix commands can be run from <a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebook</a>.  When they don't I will run them from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)\">Terminal</a> which is the MacOS version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell\">Unix/Linux shell</a>.\n",
